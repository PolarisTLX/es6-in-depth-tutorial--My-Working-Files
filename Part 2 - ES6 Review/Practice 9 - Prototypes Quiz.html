  Prototype a Vehicle

  Let's practice prototypes in JavaScript by working with prototypes. In this example, we already have a Vehicle Prototype that allows us to create Vehicles with a "make" and "year". However, we want to add more functionality to this prototype. Note that there's already an instance of this Vehicle prototype:

  let s = new Vehicle("Tesla", 2017);
  s.color = "black";

  // TODO
  // * add a 'color' field to the prototype
  // * add a 'bio' method that *returns*:
  //      A ${this.color} ${this.make} made in ${this.year}.

  function Vehicle(make, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.year = year;
  }

//WHAT I DID THAT WAS CORRECT
  Vehicle.prototype.color;

  Vehicle.prototype.bio = function() {
      return `A ${this.color} ${this.make} made in ${this.year}.`
  };
  //END OF WHAT I DID


  let s = new Vehicle("Tesla", 2017);
  s.color = "black";



  ProtoType a Vehicle | Solution

  You could have taken one of two approaches:

  1)

  function Vehicle(make, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.year = year;
  }
  Vehicle.prototype.color;
  Vehicle.prototype.bio = function() {
    return `A ${this.color} ${this.make} made in ${this.year}.`;
  };
  let s = new Vehicle("Tesla", 2017);
  s.color = "black";
  In this solution, the prototype keyword for adding the bio cannot use an arrow function. Arrow functions ignore the ‘this’ object which we need to update the Vehicle prototype. So, we see a classic function declaration.

  2)

  function Vehicle(make, year, color) {
    this.make = make;
    this.year = year;
    this.color = color;
    this.bio = () => `A ${this.color} ${this.make} made in ${this.year}.`;
  }
  let s = new Vehicle("Tesla", 2017);
  s.color = "black";
