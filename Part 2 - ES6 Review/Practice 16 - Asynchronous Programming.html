//Asynchronous Programming

//Synchronous programs run completely from top to bottom

//asynchronous programs can keep running even with an interuption
//they do this by diverting clocks to another handler


//Why use this?
//UI's and browsers, are asynchronous/random by nature,
//as human interaction is random

//Promises allow asynchronous functions in ES6

//Promises can be 1 of 3 things:
//Pending,  Fulfilled,  Rejected

//"resolve" handles successful promise calls
//"reject" handles promises that can't determine a value

let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
//for resolvable promises:
  //resolve('Resolved promise data');

//for rejected promises:
  //reject('Promise data that has been Rejected');

//for promises that are pending / take a bit of time:
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Resolved promise data'), 3000);
})

//consuming the process = resolving a promise?

p.then(response => console.log(response))
//below is for rejected outcome:
//if no resolved data is found in the promise,
//then passes the flow of data to our catch statement
  .catch(error => console.log(error));

//NOTE that this log below will post to console before the 3s are done is the setTimeout possibility above
console.log('after promise consumption');
