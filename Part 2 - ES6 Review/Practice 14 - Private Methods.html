//PRIVATE METHODS
//Javascript does not support private methods natively like other languages such as Java.
//But private methods can be emulated using closures

//Using Closures with Private Methods in ES6 is called the "Module Pattern"

const budget = () => {
  let balance = 0;
  let changeBal = (val) => {
    return balance += val;
  }
  const deposit20 = () => changeBal(20);
  const deposit10 = () => changeBal(10);
  const deposit50 = () => changeBal(50);
  const withdraw20 = () => changeBal(-20);

  //to check the balance:
  const check = () => balance;

  //give the user access to this deposit20 method:
  //return an object that is holding a "deposit20" key mapping to our "deposit20" method
  return {
    deposit20: deposit20,
    deposit10: deposit10,
    deposit50: deposit50,
    withdraw20: withdraw20,
    check: check
  }

  /*NOTE in ES6 objects, when keys and values are the same, you can just write this:

  return { deposit20, deposit10, deposit50, withdraw20, check }

  */
}

let wallet = budget();
console.log(wallet);
wallet.deposit20();

//console.log(wallet.balance);
//this doesn't work because we are not returning "balance" within our object
//we are only returning methods that ave access to the budget, but nothe actual budget "balance itself"
//it is a private variable

console.log(wallet.check());



wallet.deposit10();
wallet.deposit50();
wallet.withdraw20();
console.log(wallet.check());


//Other NOTE:
//Lexical Scoping is a concept in JavaScript that programs
//keep track of variable locations to understand where to access them.
