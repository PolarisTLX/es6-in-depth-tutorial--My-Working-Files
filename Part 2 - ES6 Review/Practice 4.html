//using ES6 to change anonymous function to arrow function
//NOTE ES6 arrow functions are anonymous by default
//because they are not declared
setTimeout(() =>

//using ES6 arrow function as a declared function
//with a name that can be used later

//NOTE that the {}  are not needed, but can be used if it is cleaner
