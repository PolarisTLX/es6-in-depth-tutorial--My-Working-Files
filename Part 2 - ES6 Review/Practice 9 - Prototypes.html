//PROTOTYPES

  //Classes are nicer way to present the prototype code (below) for people who are more used to an object oriented backround.
  //Classes are just wrapped up prototypes,
  //and prototypes are just functions
  //it really is just nicer

function Wizard(name, house, pet) {
  this.name = name;
  this.house = house;
  this.pet = pet;

  this.greet = () =>

//console.log(harry.greet);  //this does not working
console.log(harry.greet());


Wizard.prototype.pet_name;
//this adds a pet_name property to the protype
//as if we did so in the prototype declaration

harry.pet_name = "Hedwig";
console.log(harry);

// Wizard.prototype.info = () => {
//   return `I have a ${this.pet} named ${this.pet_name}.`
// };
//this does not work because the arrow => function does not create a 'this' object that can be refereced
//to solve this, use normal function decleration:

Wizard.prototype.info = function() {
  return `I have a ${this.pet} named ${this.pet_name}.`
};
//now it works

console.log(harry.info());
